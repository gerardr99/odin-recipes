    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>We begin by cooking the macaroni in plenty of salted water following the instructions on the package, trying to leave it al dente. I like to mix the smooth variety with the grated variety, but it is totally optional.</li>
        <li>Drain well and reserve in a bowl or on a tray.</li>
        <li>Chop the onion, garlic cloves, leek, pepper and seeded chilli.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC.</li>
        <li>Heat a little oil in a frying pan or casserole and sauté the onion with the garlic a little.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the vegetables and cook over medium heat until they color.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped dried tomato, the drained canned tomato, the bay leaf and a little salt and sugar.</li>
        <li>Stir well and cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add a splash of wine, let the alcohol evaporate and add oregano.</li>
        <li>Cook for 10-15 more minutes. Blend the sauce, removing the bay leaf and set aside.</li>
        <li>Chop the chorizo, removing the skin or cut it into not very large pieces and brown it in the same pan.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce and macaroni and cook for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a baking dish, add the cheese and gratin until browned to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve with freshly ground black pepper and a little fresh basil, if we have it.</li>
    </ol>
